# Lander
An error or something occured. Or this is under testing. Ask the site creator what happened!

## About
### What is this?
You probably ran all the actions needed for a website, and it is the type that just runs it and when its done it redirects here! Or maybe you experienced an error. If so, contact the owner of the application.

### How do I use this?
We use the Apache 2.0 License, so you can do basically whatever you want with it. You don't need out permission to use this, just get the URL and redirect to it whenever, whatever.

### What are the benefits of using this?
What other site is meant to be a landing page of everything? If your seeing this in the future where there are multiple, you get to use the original made by some poor kids that have not-so-good code.
